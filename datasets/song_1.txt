I found a _nn_1__ , for me.Darling, just dive right in and follow my _nn_2__.
Well, I found a girl, _adj_1__ and _adj_2__ ,Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me.
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love,not knowing what it was.
I will not give you up this time.But darling, just kiss me slow,Your _nn_3__ is all I own,
And in your _nn_4__ , you're holding mine.Baby, I'm _ing_verb_1__ in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass,listening to our favourite _nn_5__ .When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath,but you heard it;Darling, you look _adj_3__ tonight.
Well, I found a woman, _adj_4__ than anyone I know.She shares my  _nn_6__ , I hope that someday I'll share her _nn_7__ .
I found a  _nn_8__ , to carry more than just my secrets.To carry love, to carry _nn_9___ of our own.
We are still kids, but we're so in love,fighting against all odds,I know we'll be _adj_5__ this  time.
Darling, just hold my _nn_10__ .Be my girl, I'll be your _nn_11__ ,I see my future in your eyes.
