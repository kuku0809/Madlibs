_ing_verb_1_ in the _nn_1_ on a winter’s afternoon, _ing_verb_2_ my age just a little (I’m over _num_1_), I began reminiscing about my
 _nn_2_ - hood
In the _location_1_ of long ago, and _vb_1_ myself missing the old times—friends of my _adj_1_, my grandmother, our neighbours,
interesting _plural_noun_1_ in our small _location_2_, and, of course, my eccentric relative—the _adj_2_ young Uncle _weird_nm_1_ !
Yes, _location_2_ was a small _type_of_room_2_ then—uncluttered, uncrowded, with _adj_6_ lanes and _adj_3_ _location_3_ and
shady _type_of_room_2_ . The only time in my life that I was fortunate enough to live in a _type_of_room_3_ with a _adj_2_
garden—as opposed to a _location_4_ or _type_of_room_4_ or windswept veranda—was during those _num_2_ years when I spent my winter
holidays in _nn_3_ ’s bungalow on _location_5_ Road.

The _adj_3_ months were February and March, when the garden was _adverb_1_ with the scent of sweet _nn_4_,
 the flower _body_part_1_ were a many-coloured . I _past_verb_1_ the _adj_4_
yellows of the Californian poppies, the _adj_5_ pinks of our Indian poppies.
Flowers made a sensualist of me. They taught me the delight of _vb_1_, colour and _vb_2_ —yes, touch too, for to press a rose
to one’s _body_part_2_ is much like a gentle kiss . . .
Granny decided on what flowers should be sown, and where. _weird_nm_1_ , the _profession_1_, did the _ing_verb_3_ and weeding,
_ing_verb_4_ and transplanting.
