A nn_1 in location_1 was arrested this morning after he vb_1 in front of a nn_2 .
name_1 , had a history of ing_verb_1 , but no one- not even his nn_3 even imagined he'd vb_2 with a nn_4 stuck in his body_part_1 .
"I always thought he was adj_1 , but I never thought he'd do something like this.
Even his rel_1 was surprised."
After a brief vb_3, cops followed him to a Dominos, where he reportedly past_verb_1 in the fry machine.
In month_1 , a woman was charged with a similar crime
But rather than ing_verb_2 with a nn_4 , she past_verb_2 with a adj_2 dog.
Either way, we imagine that after witnessing him vb_4 with a nn_5 there are probably a whole lot of plural_noun_1 that are going
to need some therapy.
