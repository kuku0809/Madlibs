Hello Upper East Siders!
It looks like another year has come to a close, and where have we all left off? 
Lily will be under house arrest all summer.
Rufus will probably plan the neighbour's book club.
He can even bake plural_noun_1 himself, like the house husband he is.
Serena has left Manhattan for a adj_1 summer in Malibu with Grandma Cece.
She has already landed a adj_2 movie job, where her talent for vb_1 will be showcased.
Clearly her plural_body_pt are the reason she got the job.
Dan and Eric are planning a bromance trip to summer in Hamptons.
Haven't we all really wanted to see the two of them in coordinated clothing_brand_1 ties and blazers? 
Ever the outsider, adj_3 Vanessa left us shocked by stealing Dan's adj_4 novel and adverb_1 running off to Barcelona.
Chuck Bass has officially grown up, doing the right things by giving up Blair.
At least not everything has changed- Chuck's plans to vb_2 his way through location_1 with Nate, will surely bring him back to his
scheming ways.
Cousin Charlie traveled down to Florida, without revealing her adj_5 identity. 
She has adj_6 Georgina's phone number, their friendship will surely spell trouble for everyone.
And lastly, what will come of Blair and her Prince?
Will they live in the adj_7 palace and have their happily-ever-after, or will her new relationship actually include a nn_1 ?
What will next year bring?
As usual, I will be keeping an eye on the gossips for you.
So enjoy your plural_noun_1, summer flings and plural_noun_2 .
See you in September!
You know you vb_3 me
XOXO, Gossip Girl
