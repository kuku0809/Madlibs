Dear Santa...

I've been a very adj_1 nn_1 this year! I always help my rel_1 with chores around the house. It's my job to vb_1 the trash everyday
I really hope I'm on the adj_2 list. I have done a lot of adj_3 things, so I think I deserve it! I even helped name_1 feed their
animal_1 while they were on vacation in location_1. I've a few adj_4 wishes this year. I would love to see a new nn_2 underneath the
tree with my name on it! Oh, and if you could put a adj_5 nn_3 inside my stocking, that would be adj_6 too!
Merry Christmas!
