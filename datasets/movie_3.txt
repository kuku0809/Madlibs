Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there lived a very adj_1 jedi named name_1 .
name_1 worked at the adj_2 jedi temple.
One adj_3 afternoon, name_1 was teaching lightsaber class when he/she  got a/an adj_4 message from the jedi council.
There was trouble on the planet nn_1 .
name_1 packed a/an adj_5 bag and past_verb_1 onto a spaceship, obi-wan, yoda and r2-d2 went along.
As they past_verb_2 through space, they formed a/an adj_6 plan, obi-wan and name_2  would vb_1 into darth vader's nn_2 and
destroy everything the adj_7 storm troopers needed.
Leia and Rey past_verb_3 obi-wan, yoda and r2-d2 and together they all past_verb_4 the storm troopers and darth vader.
Chewbacca, han solo, finn and bb-8 past_verb_5 when they all arrived back at the adj_8 jedi temple.
May the nn_3 be with you!
