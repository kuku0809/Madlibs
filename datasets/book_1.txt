Harry Potter

The Boy Who past_verb_1
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number num_1 Privet nn_1, were proud to say that they were perfectly adj_1, thank you very much. They were the last
people you'd expect to be involved in anything adj_2 or adj_3, because they just did not vb_1 with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called weird_nm_1 , which made nn_2 er. He was a big adj_4 man with hardly any plural_body_pt_1 .
Although he did have a very adj_5 moustache. Mrs. Dursley was adj_6 and blonde and had nearly twice the plural_body_pt_1 which came in
very useful as she spent so much of her time ing_verb_1 over garden fences, spying on neighbours. The Dursley's had adj_7 son called
Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursley's had everything they wanted, but they also had a nn_3 , and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They did not think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters
