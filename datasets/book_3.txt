_weird_nm_1_ , a _location_1_ _profession_1_
_name_1_, his friend and _noun_1_ who hopes to _vb_1_ the heiress  of _location_2_ _name_2_ _weird_nm_1_
In sooth I know not why I am so _vb_2_ .
It wearies the _nn_1_ , you say it wearies you.
But how I _vb_3_ it, _vb_4_ it, or came by it,
What stuff â€™tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to _vb_4_.
And such a want wit _adj_1_ makes of me
That I have much ado to know myself.
_weird_nm_2_
Your _body_part_1_ is _ing_verb_1_ on the _location_3_,
There where your _mode_of_transport_1_ with _adj_2_ sail
(Like signiors and rich _plural_noun_1_ on the flood,
Or, as it were, the _plural_noun_2_ of the sea)
Do overpeer the petty traffickers
_weird_nm_1_
Believe me, no. I thank my _nn_2_ for it,
My ventures are not in _num_1_ bottom trusted,
Nor to _num_1_ _type_of_room_1_ ; nor is my whole _type_of_room_2_
Upon the _nn_3_ of this year _year_1_:
_adverb_1_ my merchandise makes me not _adj_3_.
