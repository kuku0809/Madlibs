With a sudden jolt, the Avengers' meeting location turned upside down!
Captain America gave a startled vb_1 and grabbed for his adj_1 shield. 
"Everyone find something to hold on to",Iron man said, firing his nn_1 jets.
The colour_1 Widow wrapped her arms around a/an nn_2, and Hawkeye shot a suction cup nn_3 and rope at the wall.
"I feel sick to my body_part_1 ," Thor said with a/an adj_2 groan.
"My body_part_2 is spinning", the Black Widow said, ing_verb_1 .
"I feel it, too, but according to my plural_noun_1 , the room is adj_3 !" said Iron Man.
Thor cried out, "This seems like my adj_4 brother Loki's doing!".
And with that, the god of nn_4 slammed his adj_5 hammer on the nn_5 .
There was a loud crash and a bright nn_6 , and suddenly the room went back to normal. 
"We must always be on guard against Loki's adj_6 magic!" Thor warned.
