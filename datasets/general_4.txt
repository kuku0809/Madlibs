Afraid of the dark

I was home alone and scared out of my plural_noun_1.
I could hear the wind ing_verb_1 and off in the distance a nn_1 was howling.
I crossed the room, locked the nn_2 and climbed onto the bed, pulling the plural_noun_2 over my body_part_1.
Then it happened, I could hear a nn_3 ing_verb_2 up the stairs.
My plural_body_pt_1  began to chatter and my knees began ing_verb_3.
The nn_4 was thrust open and there was a huge nn_5 with hair all over his body_part_2 ...
It was my father. 'Hi we are home', he said adverb_1. 'Hope you were not scared of staying home alone'.
'No', I said lying through my plural_body_pt_2
