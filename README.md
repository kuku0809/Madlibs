Mad Libs Generator, a fun and interactive Python program that lets users create humorous and personalized stories. 
It uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality, and playsound for adding sound effects.
Users can choose from several themes such as Books, Education, Movies, Songs, Sports/News, or General topics. Each theme is tied to a 
set of pre-written story templates stored in external text files. After selecting a theme, the program prompts the user to provide 
specific inputs like nouns, adjectives, verbs, and other words or phrases to fill placeholders in the story. These inputs are gathered 
interactively, ensuring that every story is unique.The project includes several utility functions for processing user input, 
dynamically replacing placeholders in story templates, and handling different themes.
